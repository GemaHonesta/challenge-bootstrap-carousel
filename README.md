## Title: One more round on the Carousel!

### The Mission
Implement the layout at the bottom as good as possible, you can search for your own images to use in the layout.
Make sure you have a working carousel using [the bootstrap component](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/carousel/) when you click on the arrows of the top.
Publish your result.
